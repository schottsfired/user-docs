# Private container registry authentication

If you are using any **private container registries**, you must create a `dockercfg.json` file containing credentials to the registry, and then create a secret, which must be called `snyk-monitor`.&#x20;

The `dockercfg.json` file is necessary to allow the monitor to look up images in private registries. Usually, your credentials can be found in `$HOME/.docker/config.json`. However, the credentials must also be added to the `dockercfg.json` file.&#x20;

The Snyk Controller will not be able to access these registries if the credentials are only stored in `$HOME/.docker/config.json`

**The steps to authenticate for private container registries follow.**

## Configure the dockercfg.json file

Create a file named `dockercfg.json`. Store your credentials in this file.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Make sure the config file is named `dockercfg.json`. The `snyk-monitor` expects that specific naming.

Where your cluster runs and where your registries run determine the combination of entries in your dockercfg.json. The file can contain credentials for multiple registries.

Pay careful attention to formatting such as whitespace and newline characters in the dockercfg.json file. Malformed files will result in authentication failures.
{% endhint %}

If credentials already reside in `$HOME/.docker/config.json`, you can copy this information to the `dockercfg.json` file.

If the `auth` entry is empty in your `$HOME/.docker/config.json`, you can run this command and paste the output to `auth` entry in `dockercfg.json`:

```
echo -n 'username:password' | base64
```

## Examples of dockercfg.json file

If your cluster does not run on **GKE**, or it runs on **GKE** and pulls images from **other private registries**, your`dockercfg.json` file should look like this:

```
{  
  "auths": {
    "gcr.io": {
      "auth": "BASE64-ENCODED-AUTH-DETAILS"
    },
    // Add other registries as necessary, for example:
    "<yourdomain>.azurecr.io": {
      "auth": "BASE64-ENCODED-AUTH-DETAILS"
    }
  }
}
```

If you are using **Artifactory Container Registry to host multiple private repositories,** your `dockercfg.json` file should look like this:

```
{
  "auths": {
    "<registry1>": {
        "auth": "BASE64-ENCODED-AUTH-DETAILS"
       },
    "<registry2>": {
       "auth": "BASE64-ENCODED-AUTH-DETAILS"
    }
  }
}
```

If your cluster runs on **GKE** and you are using **GCR**, your`dockercfg.json` file should look like this:

```
{
  "credHelpers": {
    "us.gcr.io": "gcloud",
    "asia.gcr.io": "gcloud",
    "marketplace.gcr.io": "gcloud",
    "gcr.io": "gcloud",
    "eu.gcr.io": "gcloud",
    "staging-k8s.gcr.io": "gcloud"
  }
}
```

If your cluster runs on **EKS** and you are using **ECR**, add the following:

```
{
  "credsStore": "ecr-login"
}
```

To use this credential helper for a specific **ECR** registry, create a credHelpers section with the URI of your ECR registry:

```
{
  "credHelpers": {
    "public.ecr.aws": "ecr-login",
    "<aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com": "ecr-login"
  }
}
```

If your cluster runs on **AKS** and you're using **ACR**, add the following:

```
{
  "credHelpers": { 
    "myregistry.azurecr.io": "acr-env"
  }
}
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Additionally, for clusters running on AKS and using ACR, see [Azure AD Workload Identity service account](https://azure.github.io/azure-workload-identity/docs/topics/service-account-labels-and-annotations.html#service-account).

You may need to configure labels and annotations on the snyk-monitor ServiceAccount
{% endhint %}

You can configure different credential helpers for different registries.&#x20;

## Create the secret

Create the secret in Kubernetes by running the following command:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```sh
kubectl create secret generic snyk-monitor -n snyk-monitor \ 
        --from-file=./dockercfg.json \
        --from-literal=integrationId=abcd1234-abcd-1234-abcd-1234abcd1234 \
        --from-literal=serviceAccountApiToken=aabb1212-abab-1212-dcba-4321abcd4321
```
{% endcode %}
